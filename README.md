# Mint Works Online

Mint Works Online is a web-based implementation of the board game [Mint Works](https://five24labs.com/products/mint-works). It is a worker placement game where players try to build the neighbourhood with the most stars to win.

## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The api and server-side functions use the [Mint Works Engine](https://github.com/ben-cook/mint-works) to calculate turns and manipulate the game state.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
